# Symfony 4 Resilient applications

This project is a minimalist POC demonstrating the powerful library [Resiliency](https://github.com/loveOSS/resiliency).

Using this library, your applications will become resilient to any network call done by your application.
If you're smart enough, you can also figure out how to protect yourself from a MySQL server that goes down ;)

There is no license yet on this POC, you can consider it free to use, reuse and usable for commercial use too.
